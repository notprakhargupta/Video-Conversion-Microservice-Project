# Video Conversion Microservice Project

This project implements a **microservice-based video conversion system** using **Flask**, **RabbitMQ**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **FFmpeg**. The system allows users to upload videos and have them converted into various formats (e.g., MP3, 360p, 144p, etc.).

### Key Features:
- **Video Upload Service**: Users can upload video files.
- **Gate Service**: Acts as an intermediary, forwarding the conversion request from the Upload Service to the Conversion Service.
- **Video Conversion Service**: Converts uploaded videos into different formats such as MP3, 360p, 144p, etc.
- **RabbitMQ**: Used for communication between services (Upload, Gate, and Conversion).
- **Docker**: Containerizes each service for easy deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages and orchestrates containers, ensuring scalability and availability.

---

## Architecture

The application is built with the following components:
1. **Video Upload Service** (Flask): Accepts video uploads, saves the files, and sends a message to RabbitMQ to trigger the video conversion process.
2. **Gate Service** (Flask): Listens for messages from the Upload Service and forwards the conversion request to the Conversion Service.
3. **Video Conversion Service** (Flask): Receives conversion requests, processes the video using FFmpeg, and saves the converted videos.
4. **RabbitMQ**: Acts as a message broker to facilitate communication between services.
5. **Kubernetes**: Deploys the services in separate pods and handles scaling and networking.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: To build and run containers.
- **Kubernetes**: To manage the services and deploy them.
- **kubectl**: The command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes.
- **FFmpeg**: Required for video conversions (inside the container).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notprakhargupta/Video-Conversion-Microservice-Project.git
cd Video-Conversion-Microservice-Project
```

### 2. Build Docker Images for Each Service:

Make sure to build the Docker images for each of the services (Upload Service, Gate Service, and Conversion Service):

```bash
docker build -t your-repo/upload-service -f Dockerfile .
docker build -t your-repo/gate-service -f Dockerfile .
docker build -t your-repo/conversion-service -f Dockerfile .
```

### 3. Push Docker Images to Your Registry:

After building the images, push them to your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.):

```bash
docker push your-repo/upload-service
docker push your-repo/gate-service
docker push your-repo/conversion-service
```

### 4. Set Up Kubernetes Cluster:

Make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster. If you are using **Minikube** locally, you can start it using:

```bash
minikube start
```

### 5. Deploy RabbitMQ:

Run the RabbitMQ deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rabbitmq-deployment.yaml
```

This will create a RabbitMQ pod and expose the service within the Kubernetes cluster.

### 6. Deploy the Microservices:

Now, deploy the **Upload Service**, **Gate Service**, and **Conversion Service**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f upload-service-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f gate-service-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f conversion-service-deployment.yaml
```

### 7. Expose the Services:

To expose the services, you can create **LoadBalancer** or **NodePort** services. Optionally, you can configure **Ingress** to route traffic.

For example, you can expose the **Upload Service** via a **LoadBalancer**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: upload-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: upload-service
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 5000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f upload-service-loadbalancer.yaml
```

### 8. Verify the Deployment:

To ensure everything is running as expected, check the status of your pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Check the status of services:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

Check logs for any errors:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

## How It Works

1. **User Uploads Video**:
   - The user uploads a video via the **Upload Service**'s `/upload` endpoint.
   - The video is saved, and a message is sent to **RabbitMQ**, notifying the **Gate Service**.

2. **Gate Service Forwards Request**:
   - The **Gate Service** listens for messages from RabbitMQ.
   - It forwards the conversion request to the **Conversion Service**.

3. **Video Conversion**:
   - The **Conversion Service** receives the video conversion request and uses **FFmpeg** to convert the video into the specified formats (e.g., MP3, 360p, 144p).
   - The converted video is saved in the `/converted` folder under a user-specific subfolder.

4. **Download Converted Videos**:
   - Once the video is converted, the user can download it from the provided URL.

## Scaling the Services

Kubernetes allows you to scale each service independently. For instance, to scale the **Upload Service** to 3 replicas, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment upload-service --replicas=3
```

This will ensure the Upload Service can handle higher loads by running multiple instances.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use **Flask**, **RabbitMQ**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** to build a scalable and distributed video conversion service. Each service is containerized and can be managed independently in a Kubernetes cluster.

You can extend this system further by adding more video formats, different resolution options, error handling, and user authentication.
